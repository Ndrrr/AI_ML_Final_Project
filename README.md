<h1> Final Project for the AI & ML Fundamentals class </h1>

Repository shows the sample and easy structure to construct the image classification pipeline in pytorch.

Train.py function is the one which calls each script: Loads the data using data_retrieval.py, model using example_model.py and utilities by using the utils.py

Dataset should be located at /datasets/traffic_data folder
